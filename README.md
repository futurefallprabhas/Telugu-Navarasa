# Indic-Gemma-2B-Finetuned-SFT-Navarasa-2.0 GGUF Model

## Overview

The **Indic-Gemma-2B-Finetuned-SFT-Navarasa-2.0** model is a powerful language model specifically fine-tuned for tasks involving Indic languages. Building on the original Gemma architecture, this model has been enhanced using the Navarasa dataset, which focuses on emotional expressions.

## Features

- **Parameter Count**: 2 billion parameters
- **Supported Languages**: Multiple Indic languages including Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, and more.
- **Applications**: Ideal for text generation, sentiment analysis, translation, and various NLP tasks.
- **Emotional Context**: Fine-tuned to capture emotional nuances across different contexts.

## Installation

To use the model, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install torch transformers
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s how to load and use the model in Python:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load the model and tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("path/to/Indic-Gemma-2B-Finetuned-SFT-Navarasa-2.0")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("path/to/Indic-Gemma-2B-Finetuned-SFT-Navarasa-2.0")

# Prepare input text
input_text = "Your text here in Indic language"
inputs = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate output
output = model.generate(inputs)
result = tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print(result)
```

## Fine-Tuning Details

- **Dataset**: Fine-tuned on the Navarasa dataset, enhancing the model's understanding of emotions.
- **Training Approach**: Utilizes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) methods to improve context awareness and relevance in generated outputs.

## Performance

This model demonstrates high fluency and accuracy in generating and understanding text across various Indic languages, making it a valuable resource for developers and researchers in the NLP field.
